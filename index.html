                   Once in a bright green forest, a little mouse named Pip was tired of being afraid. He wanted to show everyone he was brave, so he crept up on a sleeping, golden lion. Just as Pip reached the top of the lion's mane, the lion roared and grabbed him with a massive paw. 
                    "You're too small to be so bold, mouse," the lion grumbled.
                    "Please, King Lion, let me go!" squeaked Pip. "If you spare me, I promise to help you one day."
                    The lion laughed, thinking a tiny mouse could never help a mighty beast, but he let Pip go.
                    A few days later, the lion was caught in a hunter’s rope net. He roared in frustration, but could not break free. Pip heard the cries and ran to help. Using his sharp teeth, Pip chewed through the thick ropes. 
                    "I told you I could help," said Pip. The lion smiled, grateful for his new friend, and learned that even the smallest creature can make a big difference.
